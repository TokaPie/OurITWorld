        <p>A navigation bar at the top of a website helps users navigate your site. The navigation bar on mobile phones is typically at the top left. Internal links in the navigation bar lead to your desired pages. It allows you to direct visitors to less important pages above the navigation menu. It aids the user's search, so the navigation menu is crucial. Without a navigation menu, you can link to some pages on the home page but not all of them. The navigation bar also keeps customers on your site longer by encouraging them to browse the menu. Our website and application are still in development, so users should expect some hiccups along the way. We also develop bots that are capable of automatically responding to messages sent by customers, answering questions asked by consumers, and collecting information and requests made by customers. </p>
        <p>But there are some inquiries and requests from customers that the bot either can't understand or won't accept. Moreover, a customer clicks on the shopping cart link, which takes them to a server where they can make their product selection. Customers can try out various combinations of products in the virtual shopping cart before committing to a final purchase. The idea behind point-of-sale software is straightforward. Potential buyers peruse an e-commerce website before making a purchase. When a customer sees a product they're interested in buying, they can add it to their cart by clicking the shopping cart icon. A virtual shopping cart is updated with the item's addition. The “view Shopping cart” button gives customers instant access to their cart contents. User accounts are computer identities. User accounts have usernames, passwords, and user data. Email accounts are common user accounts. Single-user computers do not need user accounts. A multi-user system lets some users log in with a username and password. A multi-user system's public user profile contains the account owner's basic information. Only system administrators can access user activities in the home directory. E-commerce and online games allow “guest” accounts.</p>
        <p>User accounts connect users to information services and computer networks. A user account controls access to a computer, network, or similar network. User accounts are one of the best ways to authenticate and access system resources. Users can create accounts to get better offers. Sometimes the account's offer isn't valid. In order to improve the above problems and conditions and provide a good customer experience and satisfy the needs, it is very necessary to fix all the bugs and add more AI functions to the website. AI can write code. However, its code is derived differently from humans. Humans are worldly. Reality is understood by all. Humans use their conscious minds to recall the skills/content/information/experience needed to understand the requirement/goal and derive the code procedurally, logically, and deliberately. Machines lack common sense, experience, and education. A machine can derive a program without understanding the requirement/goal. The AI algorithm cheats and provides the solution. We demonstrate the goal/requirement first. Then, the machine's algorithm will search through millions/billions of trial-and-errors for the optimal solution that meets all the examples. It's the machine's code. Because the code only meets the requirements, there will be no “bug”. Despite our hopes, it is not always a general solution for unseen cases.</p>
