          <p>The process of choosing our team's name was quite random. The group simply told Toan to pick a random name as a team name isn't vital and is not of utmost importance to the project. So the final one we settled on was "Tech Rabbits".</p>

                <p>Student number: s3926689  </p>
                <p>Email address: s3926689@rmit.edu.vn</p>
                <p>Personal Interest:</p>
                <p>I have always been curious about computer games, from the production to the design. I am especially interested in e-sport and how it has been evolving so dramatically over the years. I am also eager to learn more about all the behind-the-scenes, IT-related actions that go into creating and bringing entertainment to consumers. I want to have some experience with all those activities, starting with developing an online shopping site.</p>
                <p>Relevant skills:</p>
                <p>I am well-versed in Python to a basic level. I have done some reading about bot programming but have not yet had any hands-on experience. I have also studied basic UI and figma.</p>
                <p>Career plans:</p>
                <p>From the moment I decided to start learning IT, my ideal job was always to be a game developer. A few years ago, I became interested in expanding the video game industry rather than simply playing games in my spare time. Le Minh, the creator of the first Counter-Strike mod map CS 1.6, was an early influence, as was Nguyen Ha Dong, the "father" of "Flappy Bird," a worldwide success in 2017. They epitomize the standard Vietnamese player on the international stage. Thus, I settled on a career as a game programmer, hoping to follow in the footsteps of Vietnam's revolutionary leaders Le Minh and Nguyen Ha Dong.</p>

                <p>Student number: s3968982</p>
                <p>Email address: s3968982@rmit.edu.vn</p>
                <p>Personal Interest: </p>
                <p>I have always loved everything around the computer, from games to work. Because of that, I decided to follow an IT career, a data analysis minor. In addition, I'm also interested in mathematics which is an essential part of IT, especially data analysis. As the IT industry has developed rapidly, and become one of the integral parts of our life, this is a great opportunity for me to intensively study to achieve my dream which is to become a data analyst.</p>
                <p>Relevant skills:</p>
                <p>I have been exposed to the python language but only at an introductory level. In addition, I have never had direct contact with any project as well as things related to this topic.</p>
                <p>Career plans:</p>
                <p>Since I started studying information technology, I have done some research in the industry, and have made the decision to major in data science. All research is based on my personal interests such as math and programming. Along with that, data science is a field that is growing in popularity in today's society due to the advantages it offers, such as  the use of statistics and the extraction of valuable information, which enables businesses to make well-informed decisions about their future course of action. However, what I can do now is concentrate on data science-related topics.In addition, I also would love to learn other skills related to information technology such as programming skills, machine learning, algorithms, and skills when working in groups such as presentations, teamwork, time division.</p>

            <h2>Luu Van Thien Toan</h2>
                <p>Student number: s3979512</p>
                <p>Email address: s3979512@rmit.edu.vn </p>
                <p>Personal Interest:  </p>
                <p>This is my first semester as a student at RMIT. I’m looking forward to working with the group throughout the duration of this project. Despite not having that much experience working in a group as well as a lack of knowledge regarding materials pertaining to the course preceding enrolling for this course, I will try my absolute best to adapt on the fly and work as hard as I can to achieve the best result and gain as much knowledge as I can. Perhaps my biggest hobby is playing video games, but not only as a form of entertainment. I am especially passionate about esports and have gotten many opportunities to work on projects as an Esports coordinator, team coach as well as most frequently, an Esports shoutcaster. I hope that somehow these experiences will translate into the working process.</p>
                <p>Relevant skills:</p>
                <p>I have a basic grasp and understanding of the Python programming language and knowledge regarding computer systems and information technology from my highschool studies(IGCSE & A levels). Beyond that I don’t have any other experiences relevant to the topic at hand.</p>
                <p>Career plans:</p>
                <p>My ideal job would be to work as either a programmer or a data scientist. Both jobs would allow me to work within the field of technology and IT. The primary reason I’m looking into these jobs is that it allows some creativity (coding a program or building a database) but also allows me to use logical thinking and follow an already determined framework. As well as the fact that the market demands for these types of workers are growing quite rapidly makes it so I can first and foremost obtain a job easily as well as be able to sustain myself with a decently paying career right off graduation. But for now, future career plans are still undetermined and I will have to see where my interest lies one or two years into the future in order to know for sure what I want to work as.</p>

                <p>Email address: s3937966@rmit.edu.vn </p>
                <p>Personal interest: </p>
                <p>I want to know more about the world of IT and things that are related to it. As far as I know, IT has become a very part of our life, affecting us in a way that we don’t even notice since it is too familiar to us. Since IT is so popular and so important, why don’t I give it a try? Maybe I can find a decent career. I want to be part of the ever-changing IT industry, improve myself and be able to create things that could help people, more useful applications or, if I’m ambitious enough,  teach IT to people who need it.</p>
                <p>Relevant skills:</p>
                <p>I have no experience in the IT field. Unlike most graduated students, I don’t have any first-hand knowledge in coding back in highschool because of the pandemic, but I will try to keep up with the team and help them as much as I can.</p>
                <p>Career plans:</p>
                <p>My goal for the future is to become a web developer or digital designer. I first thought I would go for something more technical and logical like software development or data analysis, but after reevaluating my strengths and weaknesses and what I really want to do, I decided to go for something more related to design. This being said, I can see myself working behind a computer and my drawing tablet, coding and designing web UI, or doing freelancer, working small commissions, etc… In either direction that I want to go, I need more experience and more knowledge so that my goals are met and I can, at last, become what I always wanted to be - an IT professional.
