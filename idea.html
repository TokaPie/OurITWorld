    <h3>Topic</h3>
    <p>
    The topic that our group has chosen to work on is E-Commerce. This is one of the most popular shopping platforms that are widely used all over the world and really exploded in popularity during the pandemic. E-Commerce experienced a spike in both popularity and users because, during the Covid-19 lockdown, everyone had to stay at their homes mandatory which made them can&rsquo;t go out and do shopping directly, so people looked for alternative ways to do so. Not only has this behavior stayed with people past the epidemic, but it has also fundamentally changed the way people approach buying products: extremely convenient, fast and the customer can contact the seller right away if they need more information. It also has changed the way businesses approach the public market and their clients, providing more methods for small businesses to sell their products without going through existing stores and deal with the high expenses associated with opening them in major cities such as Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi without needing much capital funding.
    </p>
    <p>The advantages and benefits of E-Commerce are proven through the popularity of major platforms such as Shopee or Lazada in Vietnam, which has become the preferred way to do your shopping. Along with that, most fashion stores across Vietnam have an included online selling platform attached to their local business as it is so beneficial to their sales, some shops even skip the traditional way of opening a local shop and go online as their only selling platform. E-commerce shows its potential in becoming the leading option for shopping – dynamic, flexible, and easy to use. E-commerce is something that each member of our group uses daily and is so intertwined with the development of the technological field, this is why we’ve decided to invest time and effort in this project.</p>
    </div>
  
  <div class="motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>Since E-commerce is becoming more and more popular and also really common to us, we are interested in how it works and the principle behind it and since we use it almost every day, we want to see E-commerce not only as the user but also as a developer of one – managing and developing such platform. In order for E-commerce to be a success, lots of things need to be done. It needs to be appealing and interesting to the buyers which requires understanding and keeping up with the current and upcoming trends and thoroughly studying the market as well as creating a brand signature and advertising to make the brand well-known. E-commerce is also changing some of the ways we approach some of current IT trends, such as digitizing wallet (E-wallet) – offering more payment options and a faster way of purchasing; or AI chatbot (simulated human-like conversations) – a 24/7, user-friendly AI that can provide immediate responses which dramatically reduce wait times and make product recommendations based on a user’s browsing history. This would show any employers that the developer understands the client and what can be done in order to satisfy their needs, as well as knowing what is the best approach for the company with the minimum risks possible.</p>
    </div>
  
  <div class="landscape">
    <h3>Landscape</h3>
    <p>Examples of similar systems are big online shopping platforms such as Amazon, Shopee, etc.… some systems have also introduced the concept of peer-to-peer selling like eBay, Chotot,… E-commerce is a highly competitive industry, so extreme that a 3-second difference in loading a page can determine whether the customer thinks this is a good site for shopping or not. A good E-commerce site needs to be done well both in website performance and product variety. An online shop can be offering a wide range of products with the highest quality but poor performance websites still make them a “bad” business and vice versa. Our project doesn’t have much differ from other existed E-commerce site out there, out site focuses on selling authentic sportswear and casual products coming from large brand like Nike, Adidas,… with a reasonable price. We want to make our site highly minimalistic yet informative, memorable and focus on the experience of the user.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="aims">
    <h3>Aims</h3>
    <p>We aim to explore the ways in which E-Commerce can be used to provide an effective platform for businesses and customers alike. We will be looking at the various aspects that make up this type of platform, such as the user interface, payment methods, customer service, and marketing strategies. We will also be looking into the various technologies available to aid in developing an E-Commerce platform, such as digital wallets and AI chatbots. Because there are so many factors to make a successful platform, we have quite a few goals to achieve in this project.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="goal">
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">Research and analyze existing E-Commerce platforms.</span></strong></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">Learning from past and present successful generations is never a bad idea. As a first step in achieving our goal, we will research and analyze existing E-Commerce platforms in Vietnam, such as Shopee and Lazada. We will be looking at their user interface design, payment methods, customer service, and other features that make them successful. We will also be researching the various other technologies that they used to develop an effective E-Commerce platform.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">Collect information from users and developers.</span></strong></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">We will be conducting interviews with E-Commerce platform users in order to get feedback on their experience with these platforms. We will also be conducting interviews with E-Commerce platform developers in order to gain insights into the development process. This will be done in order to collect information that can be used for the next step.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">Using the information gathered from our research and interviews, we will design a platform that is effective and easy to use. Using the latest technologies available in this project is our best bet. The most popular and important thing to do first is to create a digital wallet and an AI chatbot. Other techs to aid in the customer service aspect will be followed after that.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">Once the platform has been developed, we will be testing and evaluating it in order to ensure that it meets the requirements of the users and developers. This will involve testing the user interface design, payment methods, customer service, and other features of the platform.</span></p>
    <p style='margin:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:17px;line-height:115%;">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h3>Plan and Progress</h3>
    <p>In the beginning, the goal was to create a website to sell and sell household appliances. But after having a discussion about it and discovering several drawbacks during the stage of preparation where we were looking for tools to construct a website, we came to the conclusion that we would use figma and shift the subject to an e-commerce website centered on fashion. We are developing a website and an application that will provide users with a shopping experience that will meet the needs of many individuals in today's society, particularly women. In the beginning, we were only able to offer a select few products to our clients; nevertheless, as time went on, we worked to enhance a great deal of our other offerings in order to provide our clients with a more positive experience and a wider variety of options to choose from. During the process of developing the website, we ran into a few problems that anyone might run into, such as there are occasions when navigation is not accurate. We came up with a lot of different solutions to the problem, and after we did that, we came to the conclusion that there are certain things about the website that need to be fixed and improved, such as ensuring that there are no broken links on the page, as this will cause users to waste their time. and contribute to the resulting confusion. Avoid giving the wrong page a link, such as when you click a link on the homepage, and it takes you to another page that is also the homepage. It is imperative that the text be legible if it is to be used for navigational purposes. It is highly recommended that alt text be added to all images. In addition, make use of techniques that provide an alternative text description when linking to content that utilizes Flash or JavaScript. The overall purpose of the website is taken into careful consideration when designing the website's navigation layout, including its organization and structure. Websites hosted on a user's own domain can foster greater creative expression (but still accessible). In the meantime, websites for organizations need to have additional qualities in addition to clarity and effectiveness. We have developed and programmed a bot that is capable of responding to the inquiries and requests of our customers as a result of the increased pressures and expectations of modern life, as well as the more advanced and more developed technology. During that time, we continued to experience challenges, such as errors in the running of the code while programming and instances in which the bot was unable to comprehend all of the questions posed by the customer. It can be challenging for chatbots to handle sensitive subjects or conversations that involve a lot of back-and-forth exchanges because of the length and complexity of the conversation. Our group has been working to find solutions and ways out of this predicament, and we have some ideas. Because it is available online around the clock, the chatbot is always prepared to respond to questions posed by customers at any hour of the day. Nevertheless, chatbots are not all-knowing tools and only have a limited amount of knowledge at their disposal. During the process of deploying Chatbot, there will occasionally be some issues that are outside the scope of the chatbot's comprehension. In this instance, we have prepared a versatile plan by handing off some of the customer's questions to the consultant so that they can continue the discussion with the client. In addition, given that the primary function of the bot is to provide information and respond to questions, the sentences it sends out should be succinct and easy to understand. Customers require responses that are centered on meeting their particular requirements and gratifications. Customers are likely to become dissatisfied if the bot responds in a way that is either too lengthy, too rambling, or otherwise not in the desired direction. In addition, after the operation period has ended, we continue to perform regular monitoring and adjustments to the script so that it is tailored to the customer's preferred mode of communication. Chatbots become more adaptable and intelligent as they track user activity and learn from it, bringing them closer to users and allowing them to more accurately cater to their needs. Customers will feel more at ease and will be more willing to share additional information if the appropriate expression, intonation, and word usage are used. If we can observe the behavior of customers over a certain period of time and record that behavior, that means we will easily be able to obtain the information that we need to seek. Before the user is allowed to access their account, they must first complete the following additional steps: When a user wants to log in, they shouldn't have to go through the trouble of “1. Click on the menu. 2. Select login. 3. Fill in the information”. Instead, they should just go to the login page and enter their information there. This includes not being able to use a search bar, the page for customer support, bookmarks, a password manager, or the regular navigation system. Because there is no easy method to go to the login page from the new landing page, customer support professionals are needed to provide detailed instructions to customers in order for them to access their accounts. due to the fact that all you did was send an email containing a link to the page. When the modal dialog is hidden, it makes it impossible for password managers to work properly. We built, tested, and introduced a new landing page as a reaction to feedback from users and issues that were brought to our attention that required resolution. Instead of directing users through the steps of locating the login form on Page, support workers can save time by just providing them with the URL (domain.com/login) to the login page. This will allow users to access the page on their own. After saving the login page in the password manager, the user may easily access it with a single click, and the service will immediately fill in their account credentials. We have taken a number of additional steps, such as including appealing product descriptions and illustrations on our website, in the hope that this will encourage customers to make use of our platform. Because we did not want our customers to become disinterested in the product after viewing its details, we made the description as brief as possible. mainly due to the fact that customers won't be able to be bothered to read extensive product descriptions. Especially when it has nothing to do with the product itself. Make an effort to condense everything you've learned into ten sentences. Product descriptions, according to recommendations made by SEO professionals, should not be any longer than 250 words. Arrange the priorities in order of importance, with the primary focus being on how our side can attract or impress customers. Since there is no assurance that the customer will read the entire product description, even if it is concise, even if it is brief, it is still important to provide it. As a result, we have prioritized the information that we determined to be the most vital by placing it at the top of the list. We have proposed a number of other measures in the hopes of enticing customers to visit our website. These include promoting products on a wide variety of other platforms, running advertisements to collect key performance indicators, and inviting celebrities to promote products. our products. To ensure that our customers have a positive overall experience with our company, we are continually working to enhance the functionality of our website so that it can better serve their requirements. We will be able to make money and have better connections with customers as a result of this</p>

  <div class="roles">
    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <p>It is important to define roles and tasks in any project that you may undertake, as it will streamline the working process, allowing for each member and employee to understand their responsibilities clearly and ensure that each task is completed in the most efficient and smoothest manner possible. However, it is also important to note that in such a small project such as this, and with a limited number of people working on it, it is hard to solidly define and attribute jobs to each member in the same manner as you would in a full-scale business project. With this in mind, each member should be given a role, and then tasks and responsibilities, but won’t be strictly defined by these parameters to allow flexibility and cross-working from one member to another on different tasks. These roles are also going to depend heavily on the expertise and experience of each member, these factors are crucial and need to be taken into account to ensure that each person can contribute the most to the project by being assigned the appropriate task.</p>
    <p>Toan, the assigned group leader will be responsible for dividing and assigning tasks and roles to each member as well as be the general coordinator and proofreader, who will be responsible for checking up on progress, general assistance with issues and making sure that the group is working together smoothly. With some experience in the programming languages of Python and HTML, he’ll be responsible for creating the group website and hosting it on a  GitHub repository, this will require extensive HTML work. Besides that, Toan can also assist with coding and developing features and ideas in general using his experiences. For Khoa, he has learned how to utilize and use the Figma application, therefore, it is only reasonable for him to be the lead designer and develop the E-Commerce website using Figma. He was also responsible for drawing the timetable for the workflow of the group during the Project proposal, therefore, he’ll be responsible for extending and drawing a timetable fitting for working on the entire project, including time for working on the prototype, presentation, and technical report.</p>
    <p>Khang and Quoc will both assist with the designing of the prototype as well as working on the HTML codings of the report’s website. Quoc mentioned that he has knowledge regarding basic programming and web development, as such, he’ll help the group to research and find the appropriate tools, features and code some of it to improve the final product. Finally, Khang, who has discussed with the group regarding his lack of experience in overall IT-related knowledge and expertise. This is why he’ll be assigned more towards working on the technical report, creating a draft and assisting with polishing the report as well as generally working and writing the lengthier parts of it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="scope">
    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
    <p>The scope was briefly defined and discussed during the initial Project Proposal, however, for the final project it is crucial to come up with a much more detailed, concise and accurate scope. This will allow the group to have a clear direction and be able to set goals to work towards during the duration of this project.</p>
    <p>The first objective that needs to be achieved is to have a working prototype in terms of a website. It must also have some if not most of its features working probably as intended. But realistically it is not plausible to get most or all of the features listed in the original project proposal working within the timeframe of the project. So instead, we should focus on developing and getting the most crucial parts up as soon as possible. T	hese are: User Sign in/Log in, Item listing, Shopping cart, item search and sort by category, mobile-friendly UI and a number of products and items from many different types and categories already on the store. Other features like newsletter and QoL features can be developed later if there is still time, but it is crucial to have a semi-working prototype going before giving lower-priority features more attention than necessary.</p>
    <p>Much like the defined scope of the project, its limits are also just as important. Having a well-defined set of limits and being realistic about what cannot be achieved within the timeframe and with the tools and knowledge at our disposal is of the utmost importance to the completion and perfection of the project to a desirable level. The main feature that a fully working product would have but we will not be attempting is actual transactions and payments features. The goal of the project is not to make money, and in order to have a working payment feature as well as have it be secured by encryption to the point where we feel comfortable about the fact that we’re not actively putting the users data at risk is simply not realistically achievable with the knowledge and time we have on our hands. Another notable mention is perhaps a 100% completed, fleshed-out and working prototype is also not achievable, but this is already expected at the very start of the project.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tool">
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>The use of Visual Studio Code is arguably one of the keys to the success of this project. The platform supports a number of popular programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++. With this program, it will be easy to design a user interface and user experience (UI/UX). The fact that VS Code is free is another important aspect of the software. By doing so, we will be able to reduce the economic pressure during the process of working.</p>
    <p>Git is an excellent version control tool, which will be extremely helpful for team collaboration, allowing the team to work on different parts of the project without having to worry about a conflict. Debugging will also be easier with this program since it allows tracking of changes.   </p>
    <p>There are two key components in terms of technology that require significant research and development: digital wallets and artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots. We will investigate different payment APIs and services such as Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay in order to develop digital wallets. For AI chatbots, we will be researching various AI-driven services such as IBM Watson and Google Dialog Flow. </p>
    <p>Google Cloud Platform is a great option for hosting and deploying our E-Commerce platform. It offers a wide range of services, such as computing, storage, networking, and analytics, which will be extremely useful in developing and deploying our platform.</p>

    <p>Our team members have some familiarity with the majority of programming languages and related platforms, such as Github or Google Cloud for hosting, which they use in the development and design of websites. In particular, Toan and Quoc have programming experience with Visual Studio Code. in which Quoc will simultaneously explore things like AI bots or other services for websites like Google Scholar while Toan spends the majority of his time programming. The group's overall design will be handled by Khoa, who previously employed Figma to design. Khang, while he doesn't have a lot of IT expertise, he does have knowledge on how to use Github and Google Cloud to facilitate report writing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="test">
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>During the course of our research, we worked with people of a wide range of ages, including members of our own family, friends of a similar age, and even some notable figures like Hieuthuhai and TLinh. According to our research and the comments left by first-time users of our program, there are times when account privileges are unable to be utilized, and because the application is not yet fully developed, there is a high probability that mistakes and other issues will occur. whenever attempting to access the program. In order to further develop our application and website, we need to find bugs, make improvements to the program, and continuously solicit feedback from users. When consumers use our website or app, they will have a positive experience thanks to this, which will result in more revenue for the company. If we do not correct or improve this condition, it will lead to a number of hazards, including the fact that our website will not attract any customers and that using an application that has fundamental problems that have not been corrected can result in customers receiving poor quality goods. Aside from that, information technology is also catching up with the trend, which means that enhancing and developing the website will not make it obsolete, which is an essential demand for users in the modern era. And if we are able to do that, it indicates that we have achieved some level of success in developing websites and applications that are tailored to the requirements of our clients. Today, millions of devices access information online, so businesses should focus on website development as well as website design. How do you maximize website traffic? Website visitors will prioritize content quality. Thus, it requires employees to understand, write attractive, eye-catching images, and provide useful content. To build customer trust and increase website traffic, update content, information, and articles on a stable website. SEO improves a website's search engine ranking so users can find it more easily in the search results table. Bounce rate, ineffective keyword SEO, hacked website, website running out of bandwidth due to too many visits... Thus, you should integrate tools like Open SEO status, Google webmaster tool, and Google analytics to track activity, visits, url errors, and remediation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="risk">
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of risks coming with developing an e-commerce website. Since its focus is selling products online, it is critical that we need to keep the site secured and protected in every way. The first risk can be a data breach, hackers can breach their way into the system, obtaining both employee and customer credentials and planting malware in the company's official emails. The second risk is human error, human error is the most common risk out of all risks, employee mistakes can cause data loss or accidentally publishing confidential information, which competitor companies can exploit. The third risk can be DDOS, since E-commerce is a very competitive industry, it’s no surprise that business is very vulnerable to DDOS, which causes runtime error and unable to access the platform, or worse, causes physical damage to the server. All of the risks above have one thing in common – once they happen, they will cause serious problems, costing lots of time and money to fix. Some ways we can mitigate those risks are backing up data in case of a breakdown, using applications that can restore and recover data quickly so that it minimizes downtime, using security platforms to prevent data breaches and DDOS, train staff, and having a protocol to deal with downtime,…</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="com">
    <h3>Group processes and communication</h3>
    <p>To ensure the success of the project, clear and concise communication between group members is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the means of communication must fit the following criteria: Easy to use, commonly shared between members, ergonomic and can perform all the needed functions of relaying information between group members in the most efficient manner possible. With this in mind, the methods of communication between group members are as follows: For formal communication in need of recording evidence, E-mails will be used, mostly through the official RMIT Student emails. For normal, quick communication, Facebook messenger will be used as the main text base platform for regular exchanges and in addition to that, Discord will also be used as it allows functions of better quick file sharing and online meetings and calls when it’s needed. Beyond these needs, outside of lecture and tutorial times, a meeting at on-site RMIT meeting rooms in the SGS campus will be booked if we need formal face-to-face discussions about the group topic.</p>
