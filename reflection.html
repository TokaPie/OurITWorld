        <h3>Group Reflections</h3>
        <p>Name: Khang Vu Cao.       SID: s3937966</p>
        <p>I’m pleased with my group members and it’s a great pleasure to work with them during this course. We have a clear outline of what needs to be done, what to follow, and help other group members out. I’m okay with the group's current workflows and satisfied with what we have done together. On what could be improved, I can’t think of much since we did well as a team. I think I can be more communicative with other group members. I should improve my IT skills and learn some other skills outside the course to help with the project more, be more careful, and pay more attention to the details of the task given. What was surprising about my group is that they are really talented freshmen and have lots of skills to aid them with the course and this project. The group leader is a very straightforward and very effective communicator for the group, distributing the work evenly and to everyone’s strengths, and we can rely on him in case we need help or make necessary adjustments to the project. I learned a lot from my group members, which I am grateful for, and hopefully that in the future I can work with them again.</p>

        <p>This was the first team-based course I had taken as a freshman. On the one hand, working with the members of Group 44 was fortunate for me. In the group exercises, there was a certain amount of cooperation as well as a defined direction. This is demonstrated by exercises that are well organized, along with detailed descriptions of the tasks at hand and their allocation. On the other hand, I need to work on my interpersonal abilities. Additionally, it is necessary to strengthen other hard skills like writing and soft abilities like public speaking. One of the things that surprised me was that despite being freshmen or sophomores, everyone had utilized platforms like GitHub and figma, which I either rarely or never used. That made me become aware during the course of how much I still needed to learn about studying information technology. However, with the help of my teammates, I discovered how to divide the work among members based on their abilities and conduct work planning. Finally, I'd like to express my gratitude to the team members for their support and the positive experiences they had shared.</p>

        <p>At the start of the semester, I was clueless about what I wanted to build for the project. After multiple consultations with the team, we finally agreed on the idea of E-commerce. I thought that I could use my Figma knowledge to help the team build the project prototype, and I did. During the whole process, I gained a lot more experience working with Figma and learned more about UI design and the basics of how to develop a website and how it works. This project turned out to be quite a pleasant experience, it taught me how to work as a team and improved my communication skills, which I find crucial for real life and the workplace. I have learned a lot during this project and each step I took during this course will help me a lot in the future. Finally, thanks to everyone’s contributions and work, I am quite satisfied with the group’s effort and each member’s contribution to the final project, we didn’t do very well during the presentation and I think that we can improve a little about our presentation skills and be more confident, but the result came out almost as I expected. It has been a pleasure to work with my group members during this course and I hope I can continue to work with them again in the future.</p>

        <p>Throughout the process of working as a group, I got the chance to know each member and myself better as well as improve my skill set, both as a team member and from a leadership role. One of the first hurdles that we had to overcome is surprisingly, to come up with a suitable topic idea. The first idea that was proposed was to create a chatbot AI program, but that was quickly scrapped as we had no idea how to actually code and implement it. In the end, it was settled that a project about E-Commerce is the right one for us. At the start, progress was generally slow, as all of us had to adapt to the totally new university work environment and life, there wasn’t a lot of coordination or communication. But as the semester went on and I adapted to the leadership position better, we managed to get work done quickly and very smoothly. Each member pulled their own weights and contributed their skills, knowledge and experience to the group. Khoa had the know-how of using Figma, so he helped us tremendously in creating the prototype website for the project, or Quoc who came up with very good features and ideas using his programming experience. Khang especially did very good analysis and research about the topic as well as came up with ways to help the workflow be more efficient and smooth. Every member learned from each other along the way, and despite some shortcomings and roadblocks, in the end, we managed to pull through and complete the project to a degree that we were satisfied with. It was a great pleasure to work with each one of them, and for myself, who somehow got along just fine as the group lead, I’d love to be able to work with them again sometime in the future no matter where it might be.</p>
        <h3> Reflection as a group</h3>
        <p>After finishing the project and looking back on the effort that the four group members had done, we can see that we had done everything we can to our strengths, but still there are some weaknesses that we as a team need to be improved. Our experience as a student at RMIT University and a member of our group so far has been a really great opportunity to learn more things and work as a team, to learn how to cooperate. As this is the first time we are working together, the first hardest part is understanding each other and learning our goal. After we finished with it, we started choosing a topic upon the agreement of all team members and working out the project plan. This turned out to be time-consuming since some of us are pretty new to this concept and thus the group leader had to clarify to me and the others what we were going to do. In the end, we managed to finish the plan on time, and we think we did okay for our first assignment together.</p>
        <p>Some problem we faced as a team was that we have difficulty arranging the time we could meet each other to work on the project face-to-face since our group members have different schedules, which is acceptable we solved this problem with more online team meetings and created a group chat that we can keep track of our works and talk to each other. Another problem was that we sometimes missed our deadlines which caused some minor inconvenience. We have some minor bumps along the way, but we are still willing to help each other out and push through as a team. One thing that was surprising about our group is the way we worked on our tasks and handled problems better than we expected. We initially thought that we would have much more problems during this project and that the outcome is going to be very bad, but we can hopefully say that we have gone beyond our expectations and we are pleased with the process. Working in a group taught us a lot about cooperation and team efforts, which will be much needed for our “working life”. We learned that we can do better and achieve more goals as a team than each member alone. Our experiences in the group during this course will definitely help us even more in future projects and hopefully, prepare us for a real working environment.</p>
